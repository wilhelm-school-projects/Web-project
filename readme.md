Web app constructed in an advanced web [programming course](https://studieinfo.liu.se/en/kurs/tddd27/vt-2018) at Link√∂pings universitet.

# functionality:
It is a web app whose purpose from the beginning was to display the monitoring of embankment pumps in agriculture. However, as that would been lacking alot of user interactivity I chose to do a "mini game" which at this stage is the whole app, and will be. The "game" is to draw in real time on a shared canvas.


# tech stack:
   1. Sveltekit: Svelte, Vite, file structure for routing.
   2. Typescript
   3. Bootstrap
   4. Expressjs
   5. Firebase: Authentication, Real time database (using rules in a somewhat okey way), Admin SDK, Hosting
